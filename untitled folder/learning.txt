###what are the general steps to learning
###what are the general steps to learning
	step 1: getting and understanding info
	step 2: condense and connect the notes
	step 3: memorize and/or practices
###why and how do you preview?

	why:
	to find major conventions/concepts/big pattern to help pick out idea pieces and pattern to hang/connect things later on (to make meaning)
	
		
	if possible to preview(books, videos lists, or anything summary like)
		look at anything index-like, ex: table of content, content/topic lists
		look at anything summary like: introduction/concludtion, author's note, first/last chapter/paragraphs/, graphics, special text(bold/highlighted)
	
	and must actively predict the sturcture of the section/book, write the structure/topics down

###step 1 of general learning: basic of understanding ideas? and in the step of diving in and understanding things, how do you do things(pieces here and there), what problem you must watch out?(too much thinking!)
	
	basics:
	understanding ideas are all about elaborative rehearsal (using prior experience to make sense of new)
	To pick out pattern/connection and idea pieces and connect them together: keep on matching many different prior information(especially what you just learned, and big pciture if any)/ use outside references

	how to:
	when learning, focus on small portion of material

	if direct relavent experience, use it!
	ex: what you already know, what you just read before new materials

	if no-direct experience:
	keep finding anyting intuative prior experience to make sense, 
	if need to, use outside source/reference to help connecting to prior experience
	use gramatical pattern as well if helps

	once make sense, summarize, this is new prior experience

	if not then wait until later on

	make sure to watch out for cognitive overload, 
	take note: major concepts, terms, practices, anything common in subject/materials

###step 2 of general learning: how do you condense and connect information for memorization and practice?

	Reduction: focus on overlapping concepts over individual ones
	use less words
	
	Optimization: more connections by organization
	more graphic (like colored tables) the better!

###step 3 of general learning: when comes to memorization and practice(develop skill), what's the goal and how to do each?
	the goals: to update and/or to 1, meaningfully 2,connect.
	ex: experiment/practice/thought provactive challenges can introduce new way to update and connect

	how to: 
	set up schedule and topics for long term (on calendar) and interleaving(at least 3 rounds)
	must recall and elaboratively re-rehearse with different thoughtful charllengs/experiments/topics/context, etc...
	
	For memorization, use this flash card system and mixing with other topics, experiment/thoughtful charllenges

	for practice(to develop skills): make sure to understand the ideas first(memorization)
	then deconstructe the skills into pieces. These are the ones you actually practices
	interleave performing them in a context close to application one
	if skill needs to be highly transferable: then many contexts.

###what are the things you have to pay attention to throughtout the process?
	working memory overload
	patterns(meanings)

###when learning from new materials or new subject, what to find and collect?

	if new subject: find and collect major/common concepts/terms/focus/practices/conventions/patterns

	if new source of material: find and collect author's personal presentation habits/focus by previwing the source. see preview

	Use them as patterns to cut throught the new materials.

###how to move new info from working memory to long term memory?
	elaborative rehearsal with what you already know

###each time you practice/memorize, why should you eleaboratively recall, re-rehearse new materials in many different senarios?
	recall and re-rehearse can produce meaning, desirable difficulty, which are great for retention, 
	And because re-rehearsing with many different sanerios(topics/context/charllenges/experiment, etc...) make more connections which are great for retrieval.

###rest/excercise how to do that?
	sleep: about 7.5 hr/night and must have a set schedule
	rest for 5 to 10 mins every hr of studying
	exercising: 20 to 30 mins of intense running/day

###working memory type and size, what does that mean for anything cognitive? and what to do about these facts?
	working memory: abstract and visual
	abstract has tiny capacity: 5+-2 pieces but visual is way bigger
	working memory is the center of cognitive processing when overloaded, cognitive performance slows down.
	must reduce overload by: out source info(writing), visulize things.

###how do you develope skills? the basic and two types of practices. think parts and context and driving.
	all about context trigger behavior

	how to develope skills:

	if near transferable is ok then just
	when/where ----- action

	when you need the skills to be far transferable
	
	first you must understand the relevant ideas
	second must find and collect contexts, especially the ones where you will apply the skill to
	third, must have a general action plan to follow the triggering context
	fourth specify that general action plan to one context and divide it into many pieces
	fifth in that context interleave those pieces until you are comfortable with them
	scheduel: long term spacing
	try to recall things
	must correct/update the specifies plan with feedback

	six once comfortable, switch to another context and do it over again

###principals to better long term memory retention and retrieval? and their differences? (schedule, meaning, what does each task should do?)
	retention:
	recall and increase desirable difficulty
	schedule: long term spacing and interleave

	retrieval:
	more connections by elaborative rehearsal throught different topics/charllenges/experiements/context, etc...
	
	differences: you can retent the info, but you might not be able to retrieve it without the trigger.
	
	each time when you memorize/practice, try to make new meaning and more connections by recalling in interleave manner.
