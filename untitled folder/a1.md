  if possible to preview(books, videos lists, or anything summary like)
    look at anything index-like, ex: table of content, content/topic lists
    look at anything summary like: introduction/concludtion, author's note, first/last chapter/paragraphs/, graphics, special text(bold/highlighted)
  
  and must actively predict the sturcture of the section/book, write the structure/topics down
