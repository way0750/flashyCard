#To get the configuration setting:
###what is the Constant for ruby configuration?
	RbConfig::CONFIG
###where is the configuration? file located?
	sjdf \lib\ruby\2.0.0\i386-mingw32\rbconfig.rb
###go check out some popular directories such as: bindir
	you need something here
#CMD commands tools
###list four Ruby CMD tools

#Control flow:
###if statement: forms, if vs unless, undecleared variable, how to capture return
	variable = if statement.......return
	
	unassigned variable within control flow: if false then var = 90 end
		var still exist but assigned to nil

	form: expression ? true_block : false_block
		if expression then code elsif expression then code end
		code_block if expression

	unless statement is the same
		
	
###case statement: forms, with or without testing a case, undecleared variable, how to capture return

	undecleared variable assigned to nil like in if statement
	
	form:
	var=case
	when obj then
	when obj then
	end

	var=case
