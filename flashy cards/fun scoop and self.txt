#Scoop:
###what counts as a scoop or what are some common examples of a scoop
	a named space with restrict confinment for whatever is in it
	classes such as Array, String
	Module such as Kernel
	another file
	
###what are the unique things in every scoop?
	default self which mean also instance/class variables
	local variables
	
###compare and contrast top leave scope and class Object
	think of top leavel scope as the class definition body of the Object
	except default self is different, instance variable is different

###how to resolve constant? 3 ways. how to resolve One::Two::Three and the meaning of ::
	:: is the scope resolution operator

	with absolute path:
		with :: : search in that specific scope and all of its ancestors all the way to BasicObject
		note: modules have less ancestors
		
		with .const_get constSym
		same as ::, but enable modules to search of all class's common ancestors: Object, Kernel, BasicObject

	without absolute path:
		puts M
		start right from the scope where const is called then straight out til top level(Object, then all the common ancestors)

###how to access class/moduel method beside using the dot operator?
	Class::class_method
###how does code block work in relation to scope? scope and variables.
	code block is a scope but it gets access to all outer scope variables and default self
	however, whatever assigned within code block, stuck in it, can't be access to outer scope.
